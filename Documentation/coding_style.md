- Use camelCase or lowerCamelCase for functions and variables.
- Use UpperCamelCase for types/classes.
- Constants are all uppercase with underscores for spaces.
- Prefix private member variables with m_.
- Place the asterisk for pointer types next to the variable name, not the type.
- Always use braces for conditionals and loops to improve readability.
